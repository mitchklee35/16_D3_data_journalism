          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>
            Here you can see different groups of people. Each bubble in this diagram is a different state.
            For the Group of people that lack Healthcare, 10-20% of them are under the pverty line.
            As well, Their age median is between 34 and 44 years old and the Houshold income groups closer to $50k
            total.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you were to compare this to the the amount of people who are Obese, that comes out to
            about 1/3 of the people. The median Age is 38 years old.
          </p>

          <p>
            Smokers are in the same category here. At most, the poverty percentage in the US for smokers
            is around 22% in poverty and they smoke. The median Age is closer to 36 and as the household income
            gets lower, the amount of smokers increase.
